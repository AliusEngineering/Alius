# Alius - "another" game engine.

## About

Alius (Eng: *another*) Game Engine is a scriptSQD's multiplatform simple game engine.

Unlike Unreal or Unity, it comes with way less stuff, but offers more versatility by using readable and replaceable
code. One of the ideas is to divide the engine into separate parts and load them as dynamic libraries, so you can swap
them at runtime whenever you want!

For now, we are heading towards having a working renderer and essential components such as:

- Event system
- Entity system
- Asset management system
- Immediate mode GUI
